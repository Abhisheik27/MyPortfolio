# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website showcases my projects, skills, and contact information.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all devices.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Navigate through sections with smooth transitions.
- **AJ Logo Navigation**: Click the AJ logo in the navbar to scroll to the top.
- **Dynamic Projects Section**: View more or fewer projects with a toggle button.

## Deployment

The website is live at:

**[https://my-portfolio-seven-virid-16.vercel.app/](https://my-portfolio-seven-virid-16.vercel.app/)**

## How It Works

1. The website is built using **Next.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
2. Animations are powered by **Framer Motion**.
3. The projects section dynamically updates based on the data provided in the `Projects` component.
4. The navbar includes a clickable AJ logo that scrolls to the top of the page.
